                <h2>Top 3 Platforms for Free Game Giveaways</h2>
                <p>Who doesn't love free games? Here are the top platforms that distribute free games to users.</p>
                <h3>1. Epic Games Store</h3>
                <p>Number 1 on this list is the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong>. They are known for giving away games
                    on a weekly basis—every single week!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Why they do it:</strong> Mainly to attract new users to their platform and to create
                        traction for existing game developers who have new projects coming up. It's a great way to
                        promote future games.</li>
                    <li><strong>What you get:</strong> Usually small indie games or non-AAA titles on regular weeks.
                        However, during holidays, they often drop massive <strong>AAA titles</strong> for free.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Steam</h3>
                <p>Number 2 is the giant, <strong>Steam</strong>. Here, the freebies work a bit differently.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Game publishers themselves decide when to put their games up for
                        free.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> Often, they do this to collect feedback from users or gamers.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Catch:</strong> Most games on the giveaway list are indie games, but they are great
                        for discovering hidden gems.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>3. Amazon Prime Gaming</h3>
                <p>Number 3 is a real gem, especially in India: <strong>Amazon Prime Gaming</strong> (also associated
                    with Amazon Luna).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Value:</strong> The Amazon Prime subscription is really cheap in India. Most people
                        think it's just for shopping, music, or video, but there is a whole gaming side to it too!</li>
                    <li><strong>What you get:</strong> They give away games on a monthly basis, often including
                        <strong>1 or 2 AAA titles</strong> every month.</li>
                    <li><strong>How to claim:</strong> You can claim these free games if you have a Prime membership.
                        Since Amazon doesn't have a huge standalone launcher popularity yet, they often give you codes
                        to redeem on other platforms like <strong>Epic Games Store</strong>, <strong>GOG</strong>
                        (controlled by CD Projekt Red), <strong>Microsoft Xbox</strong>, and <strong>Amazon
                            Games</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's a fantastic perk that many subscribers overlook!</p>
