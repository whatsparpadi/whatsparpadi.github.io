## Why You Should Stop Using Monkeytype

**Monkeytype.com** is incredibly popular, but does it actually help you improve your typing in a meaningful way? The words often don't make sense together, giving no context or value to the user. It's great for a quick dopamine hit, but if you want to make better use of your time, try these alternatives instead.

### 1. TypeLit.io

**TypeLit.io** is a fantastic tool where you type out entire chapters from classic literature books like *Alice in Wonderland*, *1984*, *Pride and Prejudice*, and more.

*   **The Benefit:** You aren't just typing random words; you are training yourself to **read and type** simultaneously.
*   **Dual Value:** You get to read a book while improving your typing speed.
*   **Similar Sites:** [TypersGuild.com](https://typersguild.com), [EnterTrained.app](https://entertrained.app)

### 2. NitroType.com

**NitroType.com** is a competitive typing game that gamifies the experience.

*   **The Gameplay:** You race against 5 other real players towards the finish line by typing a given paragraph.
*   **Progression:** Finishing races earns you in-game currency to buy better-looking cars, nitro, and other upgrades.
*   **Why it works:** It's highly addictive and the competitive nature pushes you to type faster and more accurately under pressure. **I highly suggest this site!**

### 3. TypingClub.com

**TypingClub.com** is essentially the "Duolingo" of typing.

*   **Structure:** It offers structured lessons that act as a serious course to improve your touch typing skills.
*   **Experience:** It is fun, interactive, and perfect for beginners to advanced typists who want to fix their form.

### Conclusion

While Monkeytype is aesthetically pleasing, it often lacks the substance found in these alternatives. Now that you know about **TypeLit**, **NitroType**, and **TypingClub**, you can stop wasting time on random words and start building real skills (or having real fun!).

## The Odin Project vs Brototype: A Tale of Two Founders

 **The Odin Project** was founded by **Erik Trautman**, while **Brototype** was founded by **Nikhil Kilivayil**. Their journey both are similar.

**Erik Trautman** initially founded Odin Project for students who don't have the luxury of accessing private education to learn computer science, so he built a curriculum based on resources from web, including youtube, blogs, etc. The Odin Project is hosted at [theodinproject.com](https://www.theodinproject.com) where anyone can signup and start learning, founded in 2013.

Meanwhile, **Nikhil Kilivayil** started with **100K coding challenge** which focuses on C/Java coding teaching the basics and concepts, that average students in engineering colleges, especially in Kerala, struggle to grasp. And he filled that gap. He posted this entire course on youtube in 2019.

### Similar Paths

Next thing, what Erik Trautman built was **Viking Education** in 2014, the first fully online software engineering program where students didn’t have to pay until they got a job.

**Nikhil Kilivayil** also followed the similar path, by creating **Brototype**, a software training institute in the same year of 100K Coding Challenge, where the key selling point at least until 2023 was, students didn't have to pay until they got a job. Until they changed their structure completely.

### Conclusion

Did Nikhil Kilivayil copied Erik Trautman or are these just coincidences?

## 5 Ways to Speed Up Your Slow Laptop or PC

Is your old laptop or PC feeling sluggish? Windows 11 bloatware and background processes can severely impact performance. Here are 5 proven ways to make your computer fast again.

### 1. The Ultimate Clean: Chris Titus Tech's Windows Utility

The most effective way to debloat Windows is using the **Chris Titus Tech Windows Utility**. It's a powerful tool that removes pre-installed junk, disables telemetry, and optimizes your system.

**How to use it:**
1.  Right-click on the **Start Menu** and select **Terminal (Admin)** or **PowerShell (Admin)**.
2.  Paste the following command and hit Enter:
    \`iwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex\`
3.  Once the tool opens:
    *   Go to the **Tweaks** tab.
    *   Select **Desktop** or **Laptop** (depending on your device).
    *   Click **Run Tweaks**.
    *   **Remove Bloatware:** remove all useless programs running in the background.
    *   **Clear UI Elements:** Simplify the interface for speed.
    *   **Remove Indexing & Search:** Windows Search is resource-heavy. Disable it and use **PowerToys Run** or **Everything** app for instant file searches.
    *   **Uninstall Junk:** Remove **OneDrive** and **Microsoft Edge** if you don't use them.

### 2. Bulk Crap Uninstaller (BCUninstaller)

Some programs leave behind files and registry keys even after uninstalling. **Bulk Crap Uninstaller** is an open-source tool that removes these leftovers.

*   Download and run **BCUninstaller**.
*   It detects all installed apps, including hidden ones.
*   Select the apps you want to remove and let it clean up all the residuals.

### 3. Mem Reduct (RAM Cleaner)

**Mem Reduct** is a lightweight tool to monitor and clean your system memory.

**Setup Guide:**
1.  Install Mem Reduct.
2.  Run it as **Administrator**.
3.  Go to **File > Settings > Memory Cleaning**.
4.  Enable **Auto-memory cleaning** (e.g., when memory usage exceeds 80% or every 30 minutes).
5.  *Note: Auto-cleaning only works if you have admin privileges enabled for the app.*

### 4. Wintoys

**Wintoys** is another excellent app available on the Microsoft Store to optimize Windows.

*   **Boost Performance:** Use it to clear memory quickly.
*   **Storage:** Safely remove **Windows Restore Points** (which can take up huge amounts of space).
*   **Tweaks:** Fine-tune system animations and settings for better responsiveness.

### 5. Disable Unnecessary Services

Many Windows services run in the background without you knowing.

1.  Press \`Win + R\`, type \`services.msc\`, and hit Enter.
2.  Look for services you definitely don't need (e.g., "Connected User Experiences and Telemetry", "Fax", "Retail Demo Service").
3.  Right-click > **Properties** > Change **Startup type** to **Disabled**.
4.  *Warning: Be careful! Only disable services if you know what they do.*

### Additional Tips

*   **Defragment Drives:** If you are still using an HDD (Hard Disk Drive), search for "Defragment and Optimize Drives" in Windows and run it. (Not needed for SSDs).
*   **Upgrade RAM:** If you have 8GB or less, upgrading to 16GB is the single best hardware upgrade you can make for multitasking.

## Real Racing 3: The End of an Era

Real Racing 3, a mobile game that has been on both Android and iOS devices for the past decade, is finally getting shut down on **March 20, 2026**.

The game has already been taken down from App Stores and Play Stores.

### Why is it shutting down?

The reason for the cause being EA being EA and shutting down everything they touch. Also because of:

*   **Expensive Licensing**: The licensing of all the real cars they use costs a lot.
*   **Re-licensing Costs**: Renewing these licenses is expensive.
*   **Freemium Model**: The game was a freemium version with microtransactions.
*   **Developer Shutdown**: The original developer, **Firemonkeys Studios**, has been shut down.
*   **Bugs**: The game has been controlled by another developer recently, which explains the bugs in the recent past.

So, obviously, the millions of users who have been gaming this game, and including other casual gamers will be looking for alternative games that give the same immersive experience as this one.

## Top 4 Alternatives to Real Racing 3

Here is a list of alternatives that give the same immersive experience.

### 1. Grid Autosport Custom Edition

Number 1 on the list is **Grid Autosport Custom Edition**, which is a sandbox game just like Real Racing 3.
*   It features haptic feedback.
*   It is even more immersive in my opinion, and has higher difficulty.

### 2. CarX Street

Number 2 is **CarX Street**, a fully open-world game.
*   It is just like Need for Speed console games, but more like GTA 5 as you can go out of bounds at times.
*   The game is super fun and fully free.

### 3. Need for Speed No Limits

Number 3 is **Need for Speed No Limits**, another Firemonkeys x EA product.
*   **Fate Unknown**: Probably gonna end up like Real Racing 3.
*   **The Bad**: The game is loaded with microtransactions and ads (you will see an ad every race).
*   **The Good**: The game is good, and you can purchase to make the ads disappear.
*   **The Problem**: Races are too short, and the multiplayer is competitive.

### 4. Grid Legends: Deluxe Edition

Number 4 is **Grid Legends: Deluxe Edition**.

        shortDesc: "A step-by-step guide for business owners to create their own static website using AI tools like Antigravity, GitHub, and Google Forms — without coding knowledge or hiring freelancers.",
        image: "assets/tech_website_building.png",

## How to Create a Business Website Yourself (No Freelancers Needed)

In this guide, I'm going to show you how to build a professional website for your business completely from scratch. You don't need to know how to code, you don't need to hire a freelancer, and you don't need to pay for expensive monthly website builders.

We will use AI tools to do the heavy lifting for us.

### 1. The Plan: Example "Twinkles"

Before we touch any tools, let's decide what we are building. For this guide, we will build a site for a fictional business:

*   **Business Name:** Twinkles
*   **Location:** Kochi (near Pachalam)
*   **What they sell:** Products sold in kilos and packets
*   **Goal:** To get shop enquiries and bulk order enquiries

The purpose of the website is for:
*   Other businesses who needs to enquire
*   Selling our products at their stores
*   Customers who are enquiring about buying kilos of our products for an event

So the website needs:
1.  **Products Section**: Listed with MRP for quantity.
2.  **Location Section**: Showing where our store is located.
3.  **Contact Form**: For enquiries.

This is the planning of website, that is, structure or whatever it is called.

### 2. Getting Started with Tools

Next step is to install **Antigravity** on Windows/Mac/Linux whichever you are using. Signup using Google.

> **Pro Tip:** If you have a Jio 5G connection as of 2026, you will get **Google Pro**, so it will be useful while using Antigravity which again is a product of Google.

### 3. The Prompting Strategy (Using ChatGPT)

Assuming you're a business man or a business owner with no prior experience in coding, or don't even know full form of HTML, so you would probably have no idea what to prompt to Antigravity.

So, I suggest using **ChatGPT** to create the prompt for Antigravity to make the website for you. Sounds intimidating but its pretty easy:

1.  Go to ChatGPT.
2.  Prompt it to make a website with contents you want on it. For me, use the "Twinkles" data above.
3.  Ask ChatGPT: *"With this data, make a prompt so I can ask Antigravity to create the site."*

### 4. Vibecoding with Antigravity

1.  Copy paste the prompt from ChatGPT to **Antigravity**.
2.  Accept all pop ups.
3.  You will have a plan. Just type \`continue\` or \`go ahead\` or \`plan approved\` to give a green light.
4.  Antigravity will make all the files for you.
5.  Make sure your code is built on **simple HTML/CSS/JS** for starters.
6.  You can open the \`index.html\` file or double click it to see the code that Antigravity has written for you.

### 5. Hosting on GitHub

Now the next step is to find a place on a server for this code to live. We will use **GitHub** for this.

1.  Signup for GitHub.
2.  Create a **new repo**.
3.  Install **Git Bash**.
4.  Do the steps to push your code to the repo.

### 6. Going Live with a Domain

Next step is to buy a domain.

1.  Just go to **GoDaddy**, search for your company name and buy it (cheapest would be somewhere around 90 rs).
2.  Once you buy it, go to "My Products" -> "Domain Section".
3.  Come back to your GitHub tab, and go to **Settings > Pages** and make it go live.
4.  Once that is done, we need to link it with the GoDaddy site.
5.  **In GitHub:** In the root of your repo, create a \`CNAME\` file.
6.  **In GoDaddy:**
    *   Go to DNS records inside domain settings.
    *   Add a CNAME with your \`username.github.io\`.
    *   (If you need an IP, copy it from GitHub Pages settings and add it to DNS records).

*Note: If you're using Vercel the steps will differ, but somewhat similar.*

### 7. Finishing Touches: Location & Contact Form

Now your website will be live!

**For Location:**
1.  Go to Google Maps and find your address.
2.  Ask Antigravity to "update the location as [your address]".

**For Contact Form:**
1.  Sign up on **Google Forms** and create a new form.
2.  Add input fields: Name, Email, and Message (use Short Answer and Paragraph inputs).
3.  Publish the form.
4.  Get the link and open it in a new tab.
5.  **The Hacker Part:** Go to **Inspect Mode** (Right Click -> Inspect).
6.  Try to find the form element from the DOM using \`Ctrl+F\`.
7.  Copy the element details.
8.  Ask Antigravity to "connect the contact form to Google Form with the DOM I have copied".

And that's it! You have a business website running.

## Top 3 Platforms for Free Game Giveaways

Who doesn't love free games? Here are the top platforms that distribute free games to users.

### 1. Epic Games Store

Number 1 on this list is the **Epic Games Store**. They are known for giving away games on a weekly basis—every single week!

*   **Why they do it:** Mainly to attract new users to their platform and to create traction for existing game developers who have new projects coming up. It's a great way to promote future games.
*   **What you get:** Usually small indie games or non-AAA titles on regular weeks. However, during holidays, they often drop massive **AAA titles** for free.

### 2. Steam

Number 2 is the giant, **Steam**. Here, the freebies work a bit differently.

*   **How it works:** Game publishers themselves decide when to put their games up for free.
*   **The Goal:** Often, they do this to collect feedback from users or gamers.
*   **The Catch:** Most games on the giveaway list are indie games, but they are great for discovering hidden gems.

### 3. Amazon Prime Gaming

Number 3 is a real gem, especially in India: **Amazon Prime Gaming** (also associated with Amazon Luna).

*   **The Value:** The Amazon Prime subscription is really cheap in India. Most people think it's just for shopping, music, or video, but there is a whole gaming side to it too!
*   **What you get:** They give away games on a monthly basis, often including **1 or 2 AAA titles** every month.
*   **How to claim:** You can claim these free games if you have a Prime membership. Since Amazon doesn't have a huge standalone launcher popularity yet, they often give you codes to redeem on other platforms like **Epic Games Store**, **GOG** (controlled by CD Projekt Red), **Microsoft Xbox**, and **Amazon Games**.

It's a fantastic perk that many subscribers overlook!
