                <h2 id="journey-so-far">Thekku Island: The Journey So Far</h2>
                <p>So, let's talk about <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3889480/Thekku_Island/"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thekku Island</a></strong>, which is arriving on
                    <strong>February
                        27, 2026</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>Currently one of the most ambitious projects for all <strong>Malayali's</strong> (Kerala People), all
                    of us feel a
                    sense of pride and ownership about this game release.</p>

                <h3 id="first-3d-horror-entry">Kerala's First 3D Horror Entry</h3>
                <p>This is indeed Kerala's first entry into the 3D Horror Theme as well as first ever entry on Steam
                    library using the powerful
                    <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3 id="narrative-driven-experience">A Narrative Driven Experience</h3>
                <p>Thekku Island is a story-driven, first-person horror game where the protagonist, you, arrives on a
                    remote island in search of your wife, only to discover something far worse. This narrative setup is
                    beloved and follows the lineage of iconic survival horror games.</p>
                <p>For example, in <strong><a
                            href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/418370/Resident_Evil_7_Biohazard/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</a></strong>, the protagonist Ethan travels to a
                    remote plantation after receiving a message from his missing wife, and you know the rest. Similarly,
                    in <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/414700/Outlast_2/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">Outlast 2</a></strong>, a journalist frantically searches for his missing
                    pregnant wife in an isolated, fanatic village. Even in the psychological masterpiece <strong><a
                            href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2</a></strong>, the protagonist receives a strange letter from
                    his deceased wife, travels to an isolated misty town, and descends into darkness.</p>
                <p>Assuming the game
                    developers have played these games, they seem keen to present us a version rooted in our culture and
                    our
                    version of searching for a missing wife, to uncover the mystery that awaits us on the island.</p>
                <p>The developers promise us that the game explores psychological horror, classic ghost encounters, and
                    jumpscare tension, blending them into an atmospheric experience. Gameplay footage so far hints at
                    solving puzzles or investigation of hidden clues rooted in Kerala’s rich folklore.</p>

                <h3 id="system-requirements-optimization">System Requirements & Optimization</h3>
                <p>To run the game, the minimum system requirements include <strong>Windows 10 64-bit</strong>, an
                    <strong>Intel Core i5-6600K</strong> or <strong>AMD Ryzen 3 1200</strong> CPU, <strong>8GB
                        RAM</strong>, an <strong>NVIDIA GTX 1650</strong> or <strong>AMD RX 570</strong> (4GB VRAM) GPU,
                    and <strong>8GB of storage</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>Regarding performance, on February 21, 2026, within the official Discord's <em>GENERAL-CHAT</em>, two
                    users—<strong>WPG Gaming</strong> and <strong>Sebastian Varkey</strong>—expressed concerns regarding
                    the infamous optimization issues often associated with Unreal Engine 5 titles. The Game Director,
                    <strong>Athul George</strong>, quickly reassured the community: the game is highly optimized to run
                    smoothly on low-end PCs at 720p on low settings.
                </p>
                <p>To put any lingering worries to rest, Athul George
                    also noted that the development team themselves built the entire game using just a 4GB GPU!
                </p>
                <p>Furthermore, the developers confirmed on Discord that the game will be priced under <strong>500
                        Rupees</strong> ($6 in USD), making it accessible to a wider audience.
                </p>

                <h3 id="creative-minds">The Creative Minds Behind the Game</h3>
                <p>Another exciting aspect is the crew involved in the making of the game, featuring already popular
                    talents. <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aadhimusicoffl/">Aadhi Gopakumar</a></strong>,
                    who was the primary vocalist for the hit track "Kathum
                    Kaanal" in the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34388152/"><em>Officer on Duty</em>
                        (2025)</a> and handled Background Score & Programming for
                    other movies including <em>Thudarum</em> (2025), works as the Music Director for this game. Next is
                    <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/teague.sparrow/">Aswin Sunilkumar</a></strong>, who
                    worked as a Lyrical Video Editor for <a
                        href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31969600/"><em>Thudarum</em>
                        (2025)</a>, stepping in as the Creative Director for the game. Additionally, in the viral reveal
                    trailer's background theme, the gripping violin hook is played by a friend, <strong>Anuroop
                        Vijayan</strong>—a big shoutout to him!
                </p>

                <h3 id="development-timeline">Updates & Timeline</h3>
                <p>The timeline below compiles the official statements the developers of the game have shared across
                    social media and other places. The admin of the blog has been following the timeline closely,
                    gathering info and updating it daily.</p>
